# word-order-finder-from-books-with-python
Finding the frequencies of words in a book.
In this project, two functions were written for text processing using python. the first of these functions will process the book(s) and output the frequency of word order (in descending order) with selected sizes for one book. The second function will do the same operation for two different books and output the sum of the frequency of word order (in descending order) with selected sizes.
